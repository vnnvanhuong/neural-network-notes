        "By using basic CNNs, we only can solve the problem with image classification which means the inputs are images containing only one object such as a flower, a cat, or a dog.\n",

        "\n",
        "How about if an image contains more than one objects? Because we don't exactly know how many objects in the image, it's impossible to define a suitable output layer.Therefore, **the traditional CNN model can not be used to solve the objects detection problem.**\n",

        "**R-CNN** (Region with CNN feature) came to address the above problem. So, how does R-CNN work? There are two steps:\n",
        "- Step1. Using Selective Search (SS) algorithm to obtain 2000 boxes which are potential to contain objects.\n",
        "- Step 2. classifying object for each box using CNN features.\n",

        "\n",
        "Since **R-CNN** takes quite long time for training and it also takes quite long time for detecting an object, **R-CNN can not be used to solve the objects detection in real-time problem.**\n",
        "\n",
        "That was where **Fast R-CNN** was born to help. Fast R-CNN still uses SS for obtaining region proposals (boxes). The difference is that Fast R-CNN doesn't extract 2000 boxes rather than it put the image into a CNN to create convolutional feature map. Then, it finds the region proposal corresponding to feature map. \n",

        "**Fast R-CNN** is better performance than R-CNN, but **Fast R-CNN is still not fast enough when works with large dataset due to SS**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Faster R-CNN** was proposed to optimize the performance. Faster R-CNN doesn't use SS to produce region proposals instead it use a CNN called Region Proposal Network (RPN).\n",
